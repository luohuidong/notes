# Ambient enums

Ambient enums are used to describe the shape of already existing enum types.

```ts
declare enum Enum {
  A = 1,
  B,
  C = 2
}
```

One important difference between ambient and non-ambient enums is that, in regular enums, members that donâ€™t have an initializer will be considered constant if its preceding enum member is considered constant. In contrast, an ambient (and non-const) enum member that does not have initializer is always considered computed.
