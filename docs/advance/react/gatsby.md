# Gatsby

在 Gatsby 官网的教程中，有一小节叫 Creating slugs for pages，那么什么是 slugs？在 [What Is a WordPress Slug?](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/wordpress-slug/) 中提到：

> In WordPress, a slug is the bit of text that appears after your domain name in the URL of a page. Essentially, it’s the part of your site’s URL that identifies every single page on your site (except for the homepage).
